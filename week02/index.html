            &nbsp; When I read "As We May Think" by Vannecar Bush, I was under the impression that this was written recently. 
            For most of the essay, I was like "What is this dude talking about, this stuff already exists". I got to the memex part 
            and was confused as to why he was describing a computer, so I checked the date it was written and my mind was blown. This guy 
            managed to literally predict the future, so much so that I didn't even realize he was from the past. His ideas to use science to 
            better the human and accumulate knowledge were spot on in what we needed to progress ourselves. I am mostly
             just impressed with this guy for being so spot on.</p>
