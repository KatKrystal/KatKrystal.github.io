            Congratulations and condolences
            
            They would say
            That's the house of a martyr
            pointing with their nose
            That's the mother of a martyr
            
            They are building a museum
            for the martyrs.
            Some metal shelf
            a white archival box
            
            with his personal effects. </p>
